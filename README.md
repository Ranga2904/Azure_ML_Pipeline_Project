# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
This dataset holds information from marketing campaigns initiated by a Portuguese marketing institution, detail coming in from phone calls. We seek to predict through classification whether or not the client would subscribe to a bank term deposit

LogisticRegression performed adequately with an accuracy of 91.3%, with AutoML's results being only marginally better (91.5%)

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
Opportunities to improve modeling include: 
- ordinal encoding in place of one-hot encoding for variables like housing and education which may have a natural order when predicting policy subscriptions
